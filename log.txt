Gradient check...
Directional derivative check. The slope of the continuous line should match that of the dashed (reference) line over at least a few orders of magnitude for h.
The residual should be 0, or very close. Residual: 0.
If it is far from 0, then the gradient is not in the tangent space.
Hessian check...
Hessian check. The slope of the continuous line should match that of the dashed (reference) line over at least a few orders of magnitude for h.
The residual should be 0, or very close. Residual: 0.
If it is far from 0, then the Hessian is not in the tangent space.

The norm of the residual between H[a*d1 + b*d2] and a*H[d1] + b*H[d2] should be very close to 0: 2.13453e-15.
If it is far from 0, then the Hessian is not a linear operator.

The difference <d1, H[d2]> - <H[d1], d2> should be close to zero: 0.184417 - 0.184417 = 1.38778e-16.
If it is far from 0 then the Hessian is not a symmetric operator.
